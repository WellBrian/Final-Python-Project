# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

![COVID-19 Global Tracker](https://www.amprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Case-Surveillance-4-1200x800.jpeg)

## Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to uncover patterns in infections, deaths, vaccination progress, and socioeconomic factors. It combines visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analysis to explore disparities in pandemic outcomes across countries. The goal is to inform public health strategies and policy interventions by highlighting key trends and relationships.

---

## Objectives
- Visualize the global distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination efforts.
- Investigate how demographic (e.g., age structure, population density) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., GDP per capita) influenced pandemic outcomes.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving healthcare preparedness and equity in future crises.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly/Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Interactive and static visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for code and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Statistical analysis and correlation calculations (optional).

## **How to Run/View the Project**
### Prerequisites
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy plotly jupyter
   ````

2. Download the dataset (e.g., ![Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data))

---

### **Steps**

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-global-tracker.git
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
   ```bash
   Jupyter Notebook
   ```
3. Open the **`index.ipynb`** file

---

### **Key Insights**

- `Mortality Rate Disparities`: Countries with older populations or limited healthcare infrastructure exhibited higher death rates.

- `Vaccination Equity`: High-income nations had significantly faster vaccine rollout rates compared to low-income regions.

- `Socioeconomic Impact`: GDP per capita correlated strongly with vaccination coverage, highlighting systemic inequities.

- `Population Density`: Densely populated areas experienced faster initial spread but lower long-term fatality rates due to earlier immunity.

---

### **Reflections**

- *Data Challenges*: Missing or inconsistent reporting from certain regions required careful imputation.

- *Policy Implications*: The analysis underscores the need for global cooperation in resource allocation during health crises.

- *Future Work*: Expanding the analysis to include post-pandemic recovery metrics (e.g., economic rebound, long COVID prevalence).
